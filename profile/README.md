## ⚙️ What is Tap Fire Assist?

**Tap Fire Assist** is a smart cheat that simulates perfect mouse clicks for burst or semi-auto weapons. Instead of holding fire and losing control, the tool taps for you — keeping fire rates steady and recoil minimal. It’s especially cracked on burst ARs, pistols, or DMRs where **timing = accuracy = kills**.

It doesn’t move your crosshair or aim for you. It just gives you **perfect rhythm and full beam control** so every shot lands tight.
